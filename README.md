# A brief tutorial on Parallel Tempering and Simulated Annealing in Python

The objective of this project is to provide a brief tutorial on the use of parallel tempering and simulated annealing to improve the sampling of difficult-to-sample probability distributions.

This project is actively under development and is currently in its early stages.

More will be added to this repo soon!
